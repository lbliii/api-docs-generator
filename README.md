# api-docs-generator
WIP VanillaJS API Docs Gen 


This generator takes a YAML file `spec.yaml` and outputs the following:

- `spec.json`
- `index.html` 

The `index.html` page can be served as a static HTML webpage. 

## How to Compile 

1. Update the `spec.yml` file with your spec. 
2. Open a terminal and `cd` into the project. 
3. Run `node index.js`. 

The `spec.json` file and `index.html` files will update based on the new content provided.
